# PDF-Manipulator
Greetings, I created a Python script designed to assist me in managing my college assignments. Specifically, the script facilitates the tasks of reviewing, editing, and deleting pages from a PDF document.

so a while back when i was going through the assignments from my college. I felt the pain to merge and delete specific parts of the pdf, thats when i decided i would build this app which does exactly that. 

the modules used in the python project are: 
1. PyPDF2
2. tkinter
which can both be installed using the pip3 command before execution.

try contribuiting the code for more function and better working of it.
